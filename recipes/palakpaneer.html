    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Let`s get the ball rolling with the mouthwatering palak paneer. My love for Indian cuisine all started with this dish.</p>
    <p>Cubes of cottage cheese swim in a thick cream made of pureed spinach.</p>
    <p>Indian spices such as garam masala, cumin, and cardamom give it a wonderful kick.</p>
    <p>Palak paneer is best eaten with naan, a soft and buttery flatbread.</p>

    <h2>Indegrients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong><em>Paneer</em></strong>: you can use a store-bought one or homemade paneer.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Palak (Spinach)</em></strong>: It is hard to find Indian-style desi spinach leaves here in the USA. So I mostly use the baby spinach or sometimes I get regular spinach here in Costco. If you are using desi palak then do not use the stalk (stems, dandiya) which makes the gravy bitter and tastes metallic.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Green chilies</em></strong>: This is the only ingredient that provides the spicy taste and heat to the dish. So use accordingly. if you like spicy add more. If you want a mild dish then use fewer chilies.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Cashew nuts</em></strong>: It provides a rich and creamy flavor to the gravy.</li>
        <li><strong><em>Heavy whipping cream</em></strong>: Traditionally the malai is used. But the whipping cream is the closest one. This gives the smooth and creamy texture the gravy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making onion Puree</h3>

    <p>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Take onion gravy ingredients (onion, ginger, garlic, green chilies, cashews, salt and water) in a saucepan and turn the heat on medium.</li>
            <li>Let it cook for 15 minutes or until the onion becomes soft and translucent. </li>
            <li>Let the mixture cool down slightly and then transfer to the blender jar along with its cooking water.</li>
            <li>Blend into a smooth puree.</li>
            <li>Pour the puree into a bowl and keep it aside. Weâ€™ll use the same blender jar to make spinach puree.</li>
        </ol>
